\subsection*{Draw a Neurons\footnote{\texttt{github.com/conorhoughton/teaching_misc/tree/master/python\_workshop}}}

This is a picture drawn by Santiago Ram\'{o}n y Cajal of cells in the human forebrain:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/cajal.gif}
\end{center} 
It shows two different cell types, A-E are pyramidal cells, F and K are interneurons. These links bring you to some more pictures

\item \texttt{blogs.scientificamerican.com/brainwaves/know-your-neurons-classifying-the-many-types-of-cells-in-the-neuron-forest/}
\end{itemize}
It is intesteresting to consider how these shapes are formed and
informative to try writing a programme to draw them. In the
\texttt{draw\_a\_neuron} folder in the github you can see my attempt,
it makes neurons that look like this:
\begin{center}

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{eps/neuron.eps}}
\end{center}
Probably you can do better, have a go; either by modifying my
programme or writing your own.
